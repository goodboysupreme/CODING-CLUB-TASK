# CODING-CLUB-TASK
FOR CC
Had to go through a lot and was not able to produce a finished product still i had a lot of issues connecting google cloud initially so i switched to open ai and then still many issues persisted like to be able to use fast api and i was not able to implem,ent RAG as per say i thinm it will be better way if every time we made the agent search the results again<i wanted to make up a function called huess my percentile on the basis of mock tests but was not able to make it run< overall i had a fun learning experience, wish i wouldve not  procrastinagted this much,i got to know a lopt about what api is and how is it important to us , this has motivated me to pick up coding once again as a regular hobby. Thanks for the opportunity to work on this and i apologize for the subpar work you will have to see
